        <title>Derby Hatterizer</title>
        <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactives.courier-journal.com/projects/derby-hatterizer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the live project!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;portfolio-desc&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concept Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Derby Hatterizer is a web app that maximizes the fashion frenzy in Louisville surrounding the Kentucky Derby. It allows users to take/upload their photos and digitally place a Kentucky Derby hat on their heads, or even design their own. The user can then share their final image on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders at the Courier-Journal wanted to provide a unique Kentucky Derby-themed digital experience for the online subscribers. The goal was to generate social engagement by having users participate in using a digital product and sharing the result on social media.  We would measure success of the project based on unique visitors to the interactive project as well as generated social engagement (Facebook shares) from our younger online subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_persona.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Persona&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brainstorm&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I co-lead brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to come up with ideas about what sort of product we could deliver. The initial thought was that we could create a simple website that allowed the users to decorate cartoon-stylized horses. I quickly created a mockup of such a product but after some initial user testing (based on opinion of the concept alone), the result wasn’t as engaging as we initially thought. Polled potential users couldn’t see themselves spending time decorating a cartoon horse and sharing the images with their friends. Back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_horse.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Original Horse Idea&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then had the thought that, perhaps, if the interactive was a bit more user-centric, we could increase engagement and promote social interaction. Perhaps, instead of designing and decorating horses, the user could upload a photo of themselves and design their own Kentucky Derby hat? We discussed the idea in another brainstorming session and the idea ended up running parallel to an idea of one of the primary stakeholders - and thus the Derby Hatterizer was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Competitive Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a little bit of digging to see if anyone else had produced a similar product. I did this to see if there would be any overlap in the product that we were creating. I also wanted to see what is successful about similar projects and to see if I could learn from any pitfalls in the competitor’s project. In this case the Indy Star had previously produced a similar interactive featuring the Indiana Colt’s quarterback’s neck-beard, or, “Neard&quot;. Screen capture below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_neard.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;IndyStar Neard Interactive&quot;&gt;From this analysis I was able to see that once the user went through the process of uploading their photo and placing the beard on their face, in order to share their photo they were required to download the image to their local drive and the manually upload to Facebook. This was simply too bulky and added too many stress points on the user. I knew going forward in the design of our interactive the process of taking/uploading the image and sharing to social media had to be more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sketch/Task Flow&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming out of the brainstorm sessions we knew we wanted to have a mobile and desktop experience, so I created a series of sketches to get a feel for the layout and overall UX of the interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the stakeholders decided that they wanted to focus on the desktop version of the interactive and then complete the mobile version after the desktop was completed, I decided that I would design the desktop version for a screen size of 1024x768. This ensured that if time didn&#39;t allow for the mobile version we would at least be able to have the interactive viewed on tablet as well as desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_sketch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Hatterizer Sketches&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_taskflow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Hatterizer Task Flow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hi-Fi Mock up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created high-fidelity mockups at several key interaction points. Our developer then started coding the interactive based on our discussions of usability, the low fidelity wireframes and these higher fidelity mockups. I would have preferred that we create lower fidelity prototypes and completed task analysis usability testing, however, time constraints did not allow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/hatterizer_hi-fi_mockups.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Hatterizer Hi-Fi&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also created a high fidelity interactive mockup using inVision so the Courier-Journal advertising department could show potential sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://invis.io/HB33BJ6UY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; See the interactive mockup.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Usability Testing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the high fidelity prototype was completed (basically a Beta version of the project), I was then able to complete a few unmoderated usability tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Revisions and Launch&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I presented the stakeholders with some of the findings from the usability testing and proposed alterations to the digital product. I then took the key insights from the usability testing and implemented some changes within the product. Notably I clarified some of the iconography and made a few adjustments to how the user manipulated the hat objects. Once the major revisions were made to stakeholders’ acceptance we launched the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to time constraints and other projects that the Courier-Journal wanted to launch for the Kentucky Derby coverage, the stakeholders opted to forego the mobile version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product received over 1500 unique views to the page. There were numerous submissions to the CJ curated gallery, and many Facebook shares. Overall a successful project&amp;#59; however, I regret not pushing the for a mobile-first development of this project. Many users approached me about the product and mentioned that they were trying to use the product from their phone and mentioned difficulties using the interactive from their mobile device. Going forward I will both be thinking of, and encouraging a mobile-first implementation on our digital products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>Cj Grad Selfie Mobile</title>
        <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactives.courier-journal.com/cjgrad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the live project!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;portfolio-desc&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concept Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CJ Grad Selfie project is a user generated content mobile-first photo gallery that pulls in user’s photos from Instagram that use &amp;#35;CJgradSelfie. A user is then randomly selected to win a weekend pass to Forecastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Courier-Journal wanted a way to increase awareness of their Instagram account and encourage people to follow the Courier-Journal Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brainstorm&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I co-lead brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to discuss what sort of digital product would best meet their business challenge. We discussed options for scraping both Twitter and Instragram photos that use the &amp;#35;CJgradSelfie, but ultimately it was decided that they wanted to focus solely on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sketch&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming out of the brainstorm sessions I knew that since we were focusing primarily on Instagram photos, this experience should be mobile-first. This is because while Twitter has an ability to upload content from both mobile and desktop platforms, Instagram (without using special tools as a work-around) is primarily a mobile product.&lt;h4&gt;Hi-Fi Mock up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created high-fidelity mockups at several key interaction points. For this project, I even created an animation that displayed the animation elements and transitions that the user would encounter during use of the product. Our developer then started coding the interactive based on our discussions of usability, the low fidelity wireframes and these higher fidelity mockups. I would have preferred that we create lower fidelity prototypes and completed task analysis usability testing, however, time constraints did not allow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/cjgrad_hi-fi_mockups.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;CJgrad Hi-Fi&quot;&gt;&lt;video src= &quot;../img/portfolio/CJgrad_mobileDesign.m4v&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; controls poster=&quot;../img/portfolio/cjgrad_hi-fi_01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Launch&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We launched a beta version of the site in order to get the ball rolling before the majority of schools in the area have their graduation ceremonies. The plan is to implement some of the finer designer elements (animation, designed transitions, etc.) once, and if, this project picks up momentum. If the stakeholders decide to continue development of the project I will perform usability testing. This order of the design process is not ideal. I would prefer to create rapid low-fidelity prototypes of the product and let user feedback inform design decisions, but we do what time/budget allows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re still rolling out and promoting the project. I will update this section once we have some viable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>Derby360</title>
        <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courier-journal.com/pages/interactives/derby360/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the live project!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;portfolio-desc&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concept Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gannett Digital is leading the way with Virtual Reality (VR) storytelling. I was tasked with acting as a Co-Project Manager (asset-side), video editor, 3d implementation using the provided Unity3d template (from the Gannett Digital team), and finally the Interaction/Visual Designer for the Derby360 Celebration experience web content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Courier-Journal was asked to be an example of the VR storytelling experience with an extensive coverage of the Kentucky Derby with the new VR techniques.&lt;p&gt;Additional challenges arose when accelerated timelines and additional workloads were introduced as we were asked to produce around 4x the content with a launch date an entire week earlier than we had originally planned.&lt;h3&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Organization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew organization would be key to completing this project on time, so I created a filesystem organization, naming convention system, and created an asset architecture checklest that I posted in a public area that allowed my other Co-Project Manager to reference to see which 360 degree footage or other assets we currently had or still needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/derby360_lists.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Lists&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Video Editing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step in the production process was to take the 360 degree footage shot from the various photographers, organize the source footage, and edit the videos for length in Adobe Premiere. Special consideration was taken when editing the footage due to the very nature that the footage could potentially be viewed in 360 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Unity3d&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next in the process I took the exported videos and built the interactive VR (both Oculus Rift and desktop versions) using the supplied Unity3d template.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/derby360_unity.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Unity3d&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Derby360 Branding&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed branding for our VR experience for inside of the VR experience as well as the web landing page. I initially started off with sketching various logotype ideas and then refined using Adobe Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/derby360_logo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Derby360 Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Intro video&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside of After Effects I produced an intro video describing what viewers would find within our Derby 360 coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courier-journal.com/pages/interactives/derby360/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;See the video in the live project!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Landing Page&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I designed the landing page for the Derby360 Celebration to be responsive across all platforms, utilize a visually striking Kentucky Derby related image, and be simplistic in directing users to download a version of the VR experience that would be appropriate for them (based on their operating system and whether or not they had the Oculus Rift).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No exception to my usual process, I began designing as a sketch and then refined to a high fidelity (hi-fi) mockup in Photoshop. The landing page was coded by our developer based on the hi-fi mockup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/portfolio/derby360_landing.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt&quot;Landing Page&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After our launch we had approximately twenty (20) VR project downloads. Overall that number is a little disappointing, but being on the forefront of this storytelling technique is still incredibly exciting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
