Two users are then randomly selected to win a weekend pass to Forecastle.</p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>The Courier-Journal wanted a way to increase awareness of their Instagram account and encourage people, especially a younger demographic, to follow the Courier-Journal Instagram account.</p><h3>Process</h3><h4>Brainstorm</h4><p>I co-lead brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to discuss what sort of digital product would best meet their business challenge. We discussed options for scraping both Twitter and Instragram photos that use the &#35;CJgradSelfie, but ultimately it was decided that they wanted to focus solely on Instagram.</p><h4>Sketch</h4><p>Coming out of the brainstorm sessions I knew that since we were focusing primarily on Instagram photos, this experience should be mobile-first. This is because while Twitter has an ability to upload content from both mobile and desktop platforms, Instagram (without using special tools as a work-around) is primarily a mobile product.<h4>Hi-Fi Mock up</h4><p>I created high-fidelity mockups at several key interaction points. For this project, I even created an animation that displayed the animation elements and transitions that the user would encounter during use of the product. Our developer then started coding the interactive based on our discussions of usability, the low fidelity wireframes and these higher fidelity mockups. I would have preferred that we create lower fidelity prototypes and completed task analysis usability testing, however, time constraints did not allow it.</p><img src="../img/portfolio/cjgrad_hi-fi_mockups.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt"CJgrad Hi-Fi"><video src= "../img/portfolio/CJgrad_mobileDesign.m4v" class="img-responsive img-centered" controls poster="../img/portfolio/cjgrad_hi-fi_01.jpg"></video><h3>Launch</h3><p>We launched a beta version of the site in order to get the ball rolling before the majority of schools in the area have their graduation ceremonies. The plan is to implement some of the finer designer elements (animation, designed transitions, etc.) once, and if, this project picks up momentum. If the stakeholders decide to continue development of the project I will perform usability testing. This order of the design process is not ideal. I would prefer to create rapid low-fidelity prototypes of the product and let user feedback inform design decisions, but we do what time/budget allows.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>I wasn't able to return to usability testing on this project as I was quickly pulled away to a different project. As a result of this project we had around 100 submissions, and an increase in followers to our Courier-Journal Instagram account.</p><img src="../img/portfolio/cjGradwall.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt"CJgrad Wall">And Yes! We did follow through with our promise of free Forecastle tickets to the winners of the competition.<img src="../img/portfolio/cjgradWinners.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt"CJgrad Winners"></p></div>
