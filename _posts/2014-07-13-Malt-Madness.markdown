The Courier-Journal wanted to create a digital service that allowed craft beer fans to vote on their favorite beers in correlation with the hype of the March Madness. </p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>Stakeholders at the Courier-Journal wanted to provide a unique "Malt Madness" beer voting digital experience for their online subscribers. The goal was to generate social engagement by having users participate in using a digital product and sharing the result on social media.  We would measure success of the project based on unique visitors to the interactive project as well as generated social engagement (Facebook shares) from our younger online subscribers. One of the unique challenges for this product was that the product needed to be responsive and work well for mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p><img src="../img/portfolio/maltMadness_beauty-01.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt"Malt Madness Beauty">
