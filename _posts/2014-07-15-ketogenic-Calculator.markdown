When using the Ketogenic Diet as a treatment for Epilepsy, the meals must strictly adhere requirements set by the nutritionist. This often means measuring food inngredients down to the tenth of a gram. Parents must also keep a diary of each meal, Ketone levels (to see that ketosis is maintained) as well as seizure counts. This helps the both the neurologist and the nutritionist gain insight into what might be helping with seizure control and what is not helping.<p> As one might guess, all of this is incredibly stressful for the parents of children with Epilepsy, on top of the stress that occurs when their children are having seizures. I did a competitive analysis on the current set of tools available, and found that they are not easy to use. As such, I am currently designing a mobile app that will assist parents administering the ketogenic diet by streamlining tasks for creating meal plans as well as including other userful tools needed by users.</p><img src="../img/portfolio/KetoCalcPlus.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt"KetoCalc Plus Redroute"><p>Above is a Red Route (likely the most commmon path) design for this app. They are sketches of the Red Route, with one Hi-Fi mockup of what the app might look like. A mostly purple theme tested the best of the several color iterations, as it holds some sentimental value to users. Purple is the official Epilepsy awareness color. I used this Red Route Design panel as a storyboard when talking to some potential users about some of the features that this app might have.<p>The user will be able to log in to the app, so that each of their settings, meals, and diary entries could be accessible and stored, without worry, in a cloud-based storage system.</div>
