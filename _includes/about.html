                    <p>I'm an Interaction, Visual, and Motion Designer currently living in Louisville, Kentucky. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (DAAP) with a Bachelor of Science in Design. Thus far I have built my career in a variety of roles and industries that have broadened my skills to be able to handle tough design tasks in various situations and implementations.</p>

                    <p>I thrive in a fast-paced work environment and enjoy collaboration in every step of the design process. In my current organization, I'm a change-agent trying to implement a user-centric design process and a leader striving to facilitate innovation. As an Interaction designer I am often responsible for shaping and communicating user experience strategies and design. I often serve as the team advisor responsible for defining the overall UX vision throughout the digital ecosystem. I play a critical role in driving the overall UX practice, help to develop team capabilities, and work as an evangelist and thought leader.</p>
